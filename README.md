# RockPaperScissors
This is my first Javascript program from the Odin Project. The initial creation of Rock Paper Scissors did not contain a UI, all of the functionality of program/code was run in the console.

When revisiting the Rock Paper Scissors program, the goal of adding the UI was to get practice with using DOM to manipulate javascript.
